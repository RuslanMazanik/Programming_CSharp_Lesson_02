## Homework 2

### 1. Introduction

This homework is about branches and loops. We will use the `if` statement to control the flow of the program and the `for` and `while` loops to repeat the execution of a block of code.

### 2. Objectives

You are given a simple program that implements 4 main mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program is incomplete and you need to complete it. The program should ask the user to enter two numbers and then ask the user to choose an operation. The program should then perform the chosen operation and display the result.

- Learn that any input to the program must be validated.
- To understand the `if` statement and its usage.
- To understand the `while` loops and their usage.
- Complete the program.
- Test the program.
